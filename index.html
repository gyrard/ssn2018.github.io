                    <p>Rapid growth in IoTs means connected sensors and actuators will be inundating the Web infrastructure with data. Semantics is increasingly seen as key enabler for integration of sensor data and the broader Web ecosystem.  The W3C and Open Geospatial Consortium standards organisations have taken a second look at W3C SSN and published a new ontology standard for Sensors, Observations, Sampling, Actuation and Sensor Networks. Analytical and reasoning capabilities afforded by Semantic Web standards and technologies are considered important for developing advanced applications that go from capturing observations to recognition of events, deeper insights and actions. Furthermore, the contribution of semantics to sensing and actuation patterns is being explored. Major industries including manufacturing, transport and logistics, personal and public health, smart cities and smart energy, crisis management and many others spanning commercial, civic, and scientific operations that involve sensors, web, services and semantics. This workshop will continue the activity started within ISWC in 2006, complemented by special tracks at ESWC since 2010. This 2018 edition benefits from renewed energy arising from the October 2017 W3C recommendation and OGC standard, and more importantly increases significance due to the growth in IoT enabled applications.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-title">Continuation</h3>

                    <p>The first workshop was held with ISWC in 2006. Subsequently, it was held each year 2009 to 2014 inclusively. In 2015, in a context of increasing maturity that saw more sensor network papers in the main ISWC conference, including a dedicated session on a similar topic, it was held as the First Joint International Workshop on Semantic Sensor Networks and Terra Cognita.  No workshop was proposed in 2016 or 2017. Each of these activities has involved key persons organizing the proposed 2018 workshop, bringing a wealth of experience, contacts and confidence. </p>
                    <p>Workshops in 2009-2012 were closely associated with the contemporaneous development of the SSN ontology by the W3C SSN incubator Group. In 2015-2017 the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Working Group developed an updated form of the SSN ontology, published as both a formal recommendation of the W3C and as a standard of the OGC in October 2017. It is expected that this publication, in the context of massive commercial interest in Internet of Things concepts as well as many SSN-derived ontologies and potentially competing standards, promotes new interest in the SSN workshop series in 2018. Accordingly, many of the topics to be covered by the workshop are centred on the new standard, enabling feedback for early adopters and migrators. Meanwhile, the workshop continues the tradition of providing an opportunity for new ideas, application areas and tools emerging over the past couple of years that may be less mature than required for a full ISWC paper. </p>

                    <h3 class="section-title">Format</h3>

                    <p>The SSN workshop will be organized as a half-day event so as to revive and strengthen its former community and to welcome researchers from related communities. It will be highly interactive, so as to facilitate discussions among participants that could result in future collaborative work. An invited talk will be followed by authors presenting research papers in either long or short format, together with demonstrations that have been a successful feature of SSN in the past. Sufficient time will be dedicated to questions and answers for each paper. The session will end with a general discussion on experience with relevant ontologies and ideas for next steps. It is expected that most of the standardâ€™s editors will be present. </p>
